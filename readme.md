#SATExercise
SATExercise is a platform that allows students and tutors, or groups of friends, who are preparing for the SAT to solve questions as a group in real time.

When creating a study group on SATExercise, you can format your group to include only certain types of questions from specific sections of the SAT, or you can include all questions. You can add an optional timer to the group, or leave it as default: as soon as 2/3 of the users in the group have selected an answer, the question ends after 15 seconds and the answer is revealed. Then another 15 seconds to move on to the next question.

There are other customizations and tools that SATExercise provides.
